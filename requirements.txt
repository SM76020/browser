# This section explains how the code works, the requirements, and how to run the browser.

Project Overview:
This project is a simple web browser built using Electron, a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser includes basic functionalities like navigation, reloading, and opening pages in the default browser.

Key Features:

1. Navigation: The browser allows users to navigate to a specific URL by typing it in the URL bar and clicking the "Go" button. It also includes "Back" and "Forward" buttons for navigating through the browsing history.
2. URL Bar Auto-Update: The URL bar automatically updates to reflect the current URL of the webview when the user navigates to a new page.
3. Default Homepage: The browser loads a default homepage (Google in this case) when it starts.
4. External Link Handling: The browser opens external links in the default system browser instead of the Electron window.
5. Error Handling: The browser logs errors to the console when a page fails to load, including the error code and description.

Technical Requirements:

1. Electron: The project uses Electron as the framework for building the desktop application.
2. Node.js: The project requires Node.js to run, as it is used by Electron.
3. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and functionality.
4. Electron Preload Script: The project uses a preload script to enable Node.js integration in the webview, allowing for the use of Node.js modules and shell operations.
5. Webview: The project uses a webview to render web pages within the application.

Development Environment:

1. Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed on the development machine.
2. Electron: Install Electron using npm by running `npm install electron` in the project directory.
3. Code Editor: Use a code editor or IDE of choice to edit the project files.
4. Debugging Tools: Use the browser's developer tools or the Node.js console for debugging purposes.

Build and Run:

1. Build: The project does not require a build step as it is a simple Electron application.
2. Run: To run the browser, follow these steps:
	* Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
	* Ensure Node.js and Electron are installed by running `node -v` and `electron -v` respectively.
	* Run the command `npx electron .` to start the browser.
	* The browser will launch and display the default homepage.
	* You can now use the browser to navigate to different URLs, reload pages, and open external links in the default system browser.

Troubleshooting:

* If the browser fails to start, check the console output for any error messages.
* Ensure that Node.js and Electron are installed correctly.
* Verify that the project directory is correct and the `electron .` command is run from the correct location.
